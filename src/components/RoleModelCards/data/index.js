        fullText: `<p>As a war general, Prophet Muhammad (SAW) demonstrated extraordinary leadership, strategy, and mercy. He always prioritized peace and only engaged in warfare when it was absolutely necessary. He laid down strict rules of engagement, forbidding the killing of women, children, and non-combatants, and ordered that property, crops, and livestock should not be destroyed.</p>
        <p>During the Battle of Badr, the first major battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh, the Prophet (SAW) displayed unparalleled leadership. Despite being outnumbered, the Muslims won under his guidance. Before the battle, the Prophet (SAW) supplicated to Allah for victory, illustrating his deep reliance on divine support. The Quran references this event, "<span class='ayat-unique'>And already had Allah given you victory at Badr while you were few in number. Then fear Allah; perhaps you will be grateful</span>" (Quran 3:123).</p>
        <p>His leadership was not only strategic but also compassionate. After the conquest of Mecca, when he had the power to seek revenge on those who had wronged him, he chose to forgive them, saying, "<span class='ayat-unique'>Go, for you are free</span>" (Sunan Ibn Majah). This act of mercy set a profound example of forgiveness and restraint.</p>`,

He taught his companions the teachings of Islam, guiding them in both religious and worldly matters. His teaching methods were simple, direct, and practical. He used parables, stories, and examples from daily life to make his lessons relatable and easy to understand.</p>
        <p>One of his notable teaching moments was when a Bedouin urinated in the mosque. The companions were furious, but the Prophet (SAW) calmly told them to pour water over it, saying, "<span class='ayat'>You have been sent to make things easy, not to make them difficult</span>" (Sahih Bukhari). This incident exemplifies his wisdom in teaching compassion and understanding over harshness.</p>
        <p>The Prophet (SAW) also placed great emphasis on the importance of seeking knowledge. He said, "<span class='ayat'>Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim</span>" (Ibn Majah).

Despite being unlettered, he received and conveyed the revelations of the Quran with utmost dedication. His humility in receiving knowledge from Allah through the Angel Jibreel is a profound lesson in the importance of seeking knowledge.</p>
        <p>In one instance, when the Angel Jibreel asked him to recite, the Prophet (SAW) replied that he could not read. The angel then revealed to him the first verses of the Quran: "<span class='ayat'>Recite in the name of your Lord who created. Created man from a clinging substance. Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous – Who taught by the pen – Taught man that which he knew not</span>" (Quran 96:1-5).</p>

        <p>One of the most famous stories about the Prophet (SAW) as a neighbor involves a woman who used to throw garbage on him every day as he passed by her house. One day, when she didn't throw the garbage, the Prophet (SAW) inquired about her well-being. Upon learning that she was ill, he visited her and offered his help. This act of kindness led the woman to embrace Islam.</p>
        <p>The Prophet (SAW) said, "<span class='ayat'>He is not a believer whose stomach is filled while his neighbor goes hungry</span>" (Bukhari). This Hadith underscores the importance of caring for one's neighbors, a principle that the Prophet (SAW) embodied throughout his life.</p>`,

His companions were disheartened, but the Prophet (SAW) reassured them, saying, "<span class='ayat'>By Allah, I am the Messenger of Allah, and I will not disobey Him</span>" (Sahih Muslim).</p>
        <p>His leadership was characterized by consultation and inclusion. He often sought the advice of his companions and valued their opinions. The Quran highlights this aspect of his leadership, "<span class='ayat'>And by the mercy of Allah, you dealt with them gently.
